# Arduino-Based-Accident-Prevention-System-Using-EYE-Blink-Sensor
Arduino-based accident prevention system uses an eye blink sensor to detect the driver's level of alertness. The sensor is placed on the forehead to measure eye blink patterns and trigger an alarm if the driver's eyes have been closed for too long. The system can be customized to adjust sensitivity and thresholds, promoting safer Driving.
Components used / Material Required:

1) Arduino nano
2) Piezo buzzer
3) Wires
4) 9v battery(2)
5) Gear motor 
6) Wheel 
7) Relay module 10A
8) SPST switch
9) Eye blink sensor
